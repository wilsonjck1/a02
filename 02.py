"""
Problem:

    The function 'powers' takes an integer input, n, between 1 and 100.
    If n is a square number, it should print 'Square'
    If n is a cube number, it should print 'Cube'
    If n is both square and cube, it should print 'Square and Cube'.
    For anything else, print 'Not a power'

    Cube numbers less than 100 are: 1, 8, 27, 64.

Tests:

    >>> powers(4)
    Square
    >>> powers(8)
    Cube
    >>> powers(53)
    Not a power
    >>> powers(27)
    Cube
    >>> powers(81)
    Square
    >>> powers(64)
    Square and Cube
    >>> powers(93)
    Not a power
